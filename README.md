# Getting and Cleaning Data  - Course Project
Submission of Peer-graded assignment for: Getting and Cleaning data

## Overview of Analysis

  This repository contains scripts and codebooks to produce tidy data sets from the UCI Human Activity dataset to help identify the human activity, such as Walking, Running, etc based on the sensor data (acceleration and rotation in 3 dimensions) of the users phones.
  
  Code Book outlines process to convert data from source to tidy data sets
