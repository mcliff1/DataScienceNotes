# TODO - change this to a online source to keep track of papers and documents

on Jan 28, I connected a RStudio project to this repository locally


## Data Analysis
Notes on how to do a general data analysis
## Residuals Study
Pull out the primary linaer driver and look at the second

# Getting and Cleaning Data  - Course Project
Submission of Peer-graded assignment for: Getting and Cleaning data

## Overview of Analysis

  This repository contains scripts and codebooks to produce tidy data sets from the UCI Human Activity dataset to help identify the human activity, such as Walking, Running, etc based on the sensor data (acceleration and rotation in 3 dimensions) of the users phones.
  
  Code Book outlines process to convert data from source to tidy data sets
