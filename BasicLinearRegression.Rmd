## Linear Regression

Why do we use the square of delta's when estimating linear regression?

The answer is related to the construction of how the to optimizae a formula including many data points.

Start with the fact
$$
\alpha \ni \min_{\alpha} \sum_{i=1}^n \left( y_i - \alpha \right)^2 = \frac{\sum y_i}{n}
$$

This is proven by taking the derivate with respect to $\alpha$ of the left hand side
$$
\frac{d}{d\alpha} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \alpha)^2 =
\sum_{i=1}^n 2 * (y_i - \alpha) (-1) = 0
$$
$$
\sum_{i=1}^n y_i = \alpha  n
$$
We also have
$$
\alpha \ni \min_{\alpha} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \alpha x_i)^2 = \frac{\sum y_i}{\sum x_i}
$$


$$
\frac{d}{d\alpha} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \alpha x_i)^2 =
\sum_{i=1}^n 2 * (y_i - x_i \alpha) (-1) = 0
$$

$$
\sum_{i=1}^n y_i = \alpha \sum_{x=1}^n   x_i
$$

since we're just laying out formula  to get Degrees of freedome we have this for 2 populations with different variances  TODO = look this up from Wek 1 of Regression models
$$
df = \frac{ \left( {S_x}^2/n_x + {S_y}^2/n_y \right)^2 }{ \left( {S_x}^2 / n_x \right)^2} \dots
$$


The general rule for rejection of a hypothesis test is to fail whenever the probability that the sample we have seen is consistent with the hypothesis (p value) is low.
$$
\frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{s/\sqrt{n}} > Z_{1-\alpha}
$$
